# Jellyfin Quick Connect Helper Plugin

## Features

- üîò **Quick Connect Button** - Adds a dedicated button in the top-right navigation bar
- üî¢ **One-Click Code Generation** - Generate Quick Connect codes instantly without navigating to settings
- üì± **Easy Device Pairing** - Admins can simply input codes directly in the popup to quickly auth users devices on their behalf without passwords

- üê≥ **Docker Compatible** - Works with both Docker containers and native installations
- üé® **Seamless Integration** - Matches Jellyfin's native UI design

## Screenshots

The plugin adds a Quick Connect button (üì± icon) to the top-right corner of your Jellyfin interface, next to the search and user icons. Clicking it opens the small popup where you select the username you need logged in and input the 6 digit Quick Connect code and hit Authorize.

## Compatibility

- **Jellyfin Version**: 10.9.0 or higher
- **Tested on**: 10.10.7 and 10.11.0
- **Platforms**: All platforms (Linux, Docker, Windows, macOS)

## Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release DLL from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jellyfin-plugin-quickconnecthelper/releases) page
2. Create the plugin directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/Quick Connect Helper_1.0.0.0
   ```
   For Docker:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /config/plugins/Quick Connect Helper_1.0.0.0
   ```
3. Copy the DLL to the plugin directory:
   ```bash
   cp Jellyfin.Plugin.QuickConnectHelper.dll /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/Quick Connect Helper_1.0.0.0/
   ```
4. Restart Jellyfin:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart jellyfin
   ```
   For Docker:
   ```bash
   docker restart jellyfin
   ```

### Method 2: Plugin Repository (Coming Soon)

Once added to the official Jellyfin plugin repository, you'll be able to install it directly from the Jellyfin Dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Repositories**
2. Add this repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jellyfin-plugin-quickconnecthelper/main/manifest.json`
3. Go to **Catalog** tab
4. Find "Quick Connect Helper" and click **Install**
5. Restart Jellyfin

## Usage

1. **Enable Quick Connect** (if not already enabled):
   - Go to **Dashboard ‚Üí Quick Connect**
   - Toggle **Enable Quick Connect** to ON

2. **When a User Needs Help Logging In**:
   - Have the user open their Jellyfin app and select "Quick Connect"
   - The app will display a 6-digit code
   - The Admin will Click the Quick Connect button (üîí icon) in the top-right corner of your Jellyfin web interface
   - A small overlay will appear

3. **Complete the Authentication**:
   - Select the user from the dropdown menu
   - Enter the 6-digit code the user is seeing on their device
   - Click submit
   - Within a few seconds you should see a green confirmation message or red failure and the popup should close itself.

## Configuration

The plugin has a simple configuration page accessible from:
**Dashboard ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Quick Connect Helper ‚Üí Settings**

Currently, there are no configuration options needed - the plugin works out of the box!

## How It Works

The plugin:
1. Injects a client-side script into Jellyfin's web interface
2. Adds a Quick Connect button to the navigation bar
3. Provides an intuitive overlay interface for admins to assist with Quick Connect authentication
4. Uses Jellyfin's native Quick Connect API to authorize codes entered and allow admins to help authorize any users devices without leaving the page or video they are on.
5. Automatically detects and works with both Docker and native installations

## Development

### Building from Source

Requirements:
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Jellyfin Server (for testing)

Build steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jellyfin-plugin-quickconnecthelper.git
cd jellyfin-plugin-quickconnecthelper
dotnet build -c Release
```

The compiled DLL will be in `bin/Release/net8.0/`

## Troubleshooting

### Button Not Appearing

1. **Clear browser cache**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac) to force refresh
2. **Check plugin is loaded**: Look for `[QuickConnectHelper]` messages in browser console (F12)
3. **Verify installation**: Check that the DLL exists in the plugins directory
4. **Check server logs**: Look for "Quick Connect Helper" in Jellyfin logs

### File Permissions Issue

If the plugin button doesn't appear after installation and clearing cache, you may need to check the permissions on Jellyfin's `index.html` file:

1. **Locate the index.html file**:
   - Native installation: typically `/usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html`
   - Docker installation: typically `/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/index.html`

2. **Check current permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -l /path/to/index.html
   ```

3. **If permissions are too restrictive** (e.g., `700`), update them:
   ```bash
   chmod 755 /path/to/index.html
   ```
   Or if you continue to have issues:
   ```bash
   chmod 777 /path/to/index.html
   ```

   **Note**: The Jellyfin stock installation sometimes sets restrictive permissions on this file, which can prevent plugins from injecting their scripts properly. The appropriate permission level depends on your specific setup and security requirements.

### Quick Connect Disabled Message

If you see "Quick Connect is currently disabled", you need to:
1. Go to **Dashboard ‚Üí Quick Connect**
2. Toggle **Enable Quick Connect** to ON
3. Click **Save**
4. Refresh the web interface

### Docker Compatibility Issues

The plugin automatically detects Docker installations. If you're having issues:
1. Check that `JELLYFIN_WEB_DIR` environment variable is set correctly
2. Verify the plugin DLL is in `/config/plugins/Quick Connect Helper_1.0.0.0/`
3. Restart the container completely (not just Jellyfin)

## Security Note

Quick Connect codes are:
- **Valid for 10 minutes** by default
- **Single-use** - automatically deactivated after pairing
- **Securely generated** by Jellyfin's core authentication system

The plugin simply provides a UI convenience feature and doesn't modify Quick Connect's security mechanisms.
